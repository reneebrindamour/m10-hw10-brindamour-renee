Module 10, Assignment 10 Summary
By: Renee Brindamour

I did not encounter any issues with this assignment. I was introduced to the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology during my undergraduate studies. Although it has been a couple of years since then, I revisited the material and watched the provided videos, which reminded me of what I had learned in previous classes.

The BEM conventions are straightforward and offer an excellent way to keep CSS files organized and maintainable. By using properly named BEM class names, avoiding nested and combined selectors, and steering clear of tag and ID selectors, the code becomes more modular and easier to manage. This assignment reinforced the importance of BEM in maintaining clean and reusable code.

The only place where I kept an ID was in the footer, which was linked to the JavaScript code. JavaScript tends to overwhelm me, and I was concerned that changing the ID might disrupt the functionality of the script.
